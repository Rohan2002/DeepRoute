# DeepRoute
Track Experimental Mouse and Pup using Computer Vision

# Project
This is just an experimental demonstration I made to track mice movement to
learn a bit more about computer vision techniques. This project demonstrates
the classic object-detection paradigm.

# Technologies
1. To label the data, I used labelimg software provided in this github link https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg
2. I trained the pretrained SSD Mobilenet model, and got a precision of over 80% on my test set.
